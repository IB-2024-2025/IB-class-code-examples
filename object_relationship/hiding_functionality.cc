 * @brief Illustrates how to hide functionality that exists in the base class.
 *
 *        In C++, it is not possible to remove or restrict functionality 
 *        from a base class other than by modifying the source code. 
 *        However, in a derived class, it is possible to hide functionality 
 *        that exists in the base class, so that it can not be accessed 
 *        through the derived class. 
 *        This can be done simply by changing the relevant access specifier.
 *        In this code we make a public member private
 *

#include <iostream>

class Base {
 public:
  int value_;
};

class Derived : public Base {
 public:
  // We can't initialize value_, since it's a Base member (Base must initialize it)
  // But we can assign it a value
  Derived(const int value) {
    value_ = value;
  }
 private:
  using Base::value_;
};

int main() {
  Derived derived(7);
  // The following won't work because value_ has been redefined as private
  std::cout << derived.value_;
return 0;
}
