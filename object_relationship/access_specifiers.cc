 * @brief Illustrates the behaviour of access specifiers with inheritance
 *        Private members can only be accessed by member functions of the 
 *        same class or friends. 
 *        This means derived classes can not access private members of the base class directly!
 *        The protected access specifier allows the class the member belongs to, friends, 
 *        and derived classes to access the member. 
 *        However, protected members are not accessible from outside the class.
 *
 *        Uncomment the commented lines to study the behaviour
