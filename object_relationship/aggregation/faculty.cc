 * @brief A simple example to illustrate aggregation of objects
 *        The example uses classes Teacher and Department.
 *        Here we’re going to make a couple of simplifications: 
 *        First, the department will only hold one teacher. 
 *        Second, the teacher will be unaware of what department they’re part of.

  Teacher einstein{"Albert Einstein"}; // create a teacher

  { // Create a department and use the constructor parameter to pass the teacher to it.
    Department department{einstein};
  } // department goes out of scope here and is destroyed

  // einstein still exists here, but the department doesn't
  std::cout << einstein.name() << " still exists!\n";
