 * @brief Illustrates the role of constructors in the initialization of derived classes. 
 *        As we know how to initialize base class members, there’s no need to keep 
 *        our member variables public (they should be private!)
 *        We make our member variables private again, as they should be
 *        Remember:
 *         - Public members can be accessed by anybody
 *         - Private members can only be accessed by member functions of the same class
 *        Derived classes can not access private members of the base class directly! 
 *        Derived classes will need to use access functions to access private members of the base class
