 * @brief Illustrates the role of constructors in the initialization of derived classes. 
 *        There is no way to initialize id_ when we create a Derived object
          What if we want to set both cost_ and id_ when we create a Derived object?
 *        Third attempt:  
 *          - To explicitly choose which Base class constructor will be called, 
 *            simply add a call to the base class Constructor in the initialization 
 *            list of the derived class
 *        The code uses the base class constructor Base(int) to initialize id_ to 5, 
 *        and the derived class constructor will be used to initialize cost_ to 1.3!
 *        The details of the process are:
 *          1. Memory for derived is allocated.
 *          2. The Derived(double, int) constructor is called, where cost = 1.3, and id = 5
 *          3. The compiler looks to see if we’ve asked for a particular Base class constructor. We have! So it calls Base(int) with id = 5.
 *          4. The base class constructor initialization list sets id_ to 5
 *          5. The base class constructor body executes, which does nothing
 *          6. The base class constructor returns
 *          7. The derived class constructor initialization list sets cost_ to 1.3
 *          8. The derived class constructor body executes, which does nothing
 *          9. The derived class constructor returns
