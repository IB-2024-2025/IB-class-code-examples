 * @brief class definition example
 *
 * Class consists of zero or more members
 * Members can be of various types: data member, function member, and others (e.g., type member)
 * Data members define representation of object of class
 * Function members (also called member functions) provide operations on such objects
 * Interface is part of class that is directly accessible to its users
 * Implementation is part of class that its users access only indirectly through interface
 * Can control level of access that users of class have to its members
 * Three levels of access: private, protected, and public
 *    private: member can only be accessed by other members of class and friends of class
 *    public: member can be accessed by any code
 *    protected: relates to inheritance (discussion deferred until later)
 * public members constitute the class interface
 * private members constitute the class implementation
