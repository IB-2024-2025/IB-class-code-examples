 * @brief Date class Example
 *        In addition to holding data, classes can also contain functions! 
 *        Functions defined inside of a class are called member functions (or sometimes methods). 
 *        Member functions can be defined inside or outside of the class definition. 
 *        Here we define them inside the class for simplicity.
